# CyberPhyMorseCode

A repo for developing a cyber physical channel.

## Covert Design Overview

The goal of this covert channel is to exfiltrate messages from a building using visual signals. Our covert channel uses a smartphone Morse code converter application to encode and transmit Morse code messages through the use of the phone's flashlight. 

In order to build this channel the transmitter must have a smartphone with the Morse Code Converter App installed, as well as access to a window through which the encoded message can be flashed to a receiver outside. The receiver must have access to a video recording device as well as our decoding script and the necessary dependencies. The methodology of the scripts is to extract translate the video to images. The brightness of the images is then used to construct the Morse code and decode the message.
