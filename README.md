# CyberPhyMorseCode

A repo for developing a cyber physical channel.

## Materials

For a full writeup on this topic, see the Covert Channel Writeup in the lab folder. Also, we did not push our original videos and frame-by-frame images to this repo due to their large size, but we are happy to supply them however is preferred.

## Usage

`python decoding_flashlight.py`

This repo uses the provided skeleton code for the Morse Code Covert Channel. All of our work uses the .py file, where we added a single run statement at the very bottom where the input video path is passed. We filled in all suggested functions and added two additional functions to help calculate useful threshold and unit values as described in the writeup. We left in the print statements that indicate this calculation but otherwise purged them and commented out the plotting of the graph (which we moved to the end so it did not interrupt the program).
